        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large poblano chiles</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Oaxaca, Monterey Jack, or mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
            <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong></li>
            <li>3 Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 white onion</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Roast the chiles:</strong> Place poblano chiles over an open flame or under a broiler until the skin is blackened and blistered. Transfer to a covered bowl or sealed plastic bag to steam for 10 minutes, then peel off the skin. Carefully make a slit and remove seeds.</li>
            <li><strong>Stuff the chiles:</strong> Fill each chile with shredded cheese, then gently close the opening with toothpicks if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the batter:</strong> Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form, then gently fold in the yolks and a pinch of salt. Lightly dust each stuffed chile with flour, then coat with the egg batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the chiles:</strong> Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the battered chiles until golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Blend tomatoes, onion, garlic, broth, salt, and pepper until smooth. Simmer in a saucepan for 10–15 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Pour warm tomato sauce over the chiles and serve immediately. Pair with rice or beans for a full meal.</li>
        </ol>
